# For repository named 'myblog' (appears at akabarki76.github.io/myblog)
url: "https://akabarki76.github.io"
baseurl: "/myblog"  # ← This is crucial!

# OR if you want akabarki76.github.io directly:
# (requires renaming repo to 'akabarki76.github.io')
url: "https://akabarki76.github.io"
# Remove baseurl completely
